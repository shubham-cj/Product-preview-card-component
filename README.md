## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project I used CSS flexbox a lot than CSS Grid and I learned about CSS Flexbox while workig on this project from Youtube.
I've learnd about `flexbox-direction` - main axis and cross axis, how to `justify-content` and `align-item`, and the `gap` property it's prity simple and easy to understand by making more projets with this.

```css
body {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    font-family: "Montserrat";
    background: hsl(30, 38%, 92%);
    min-height: 100vh;
}
```
```css
button {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    gap: 10px;
    align-items: center;
}
```

### Continued development

I think in some cases using Flexbox is a great way than using CSS Grid. And in some cases Grid is best, Flexbox gets complicated. 
So, I will use Flexbox more than Grid but Grid is also important because it's very easy to use in some situations.
